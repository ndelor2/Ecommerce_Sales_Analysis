## Portfolio Project – E-commerce Sales Analysis
Elist is an e-commerce company that sells electronic products globally.  Using Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, and aggregation functions on a sample dataset, I was able to uncover insights on sales, products, growth rates, operational efficiency, and the effectiveness of a recently launched loyalty program.  I also analyzed the success of different marketing platforms to give recommendations on which platforms to improve.  
## Summary of Insights and Recommendations
**Yearly Trends** – From 2019-2022, average annual sales reached 23K orders with over 6 MIL in average revenue and average order value was $253.  2020 saw the largest increase in growth with orders increasing 102%, revenue increasing 165%, and average order value increasing 31% from their 2019 levels.  This trend would not continue with revenue and average order value falling in 2021 and, in 2022, falling slightly above their 2019 levels.  

**Seasonality** – Sales were higher in spring and winter months confirming seasonality present in the sales data.  The largest increase in average order value was 18% in in September 2022 possibly due to a special promotion.  

**Products** –  From 2019-2022, the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor generated the highest revenue across all products while Bose Soundsport Headphones generated the least except in 2019 when the product wasn’t sold.  Apple Airpods were the second best selling item every year except for 2020 when the Macbook Air Laptop claimed second best, possibly related to the pandemic stimulus checks.  

**Loyalty Program** – The loyalty program took a couple years to take effect but in 2022, the loyalty program members had 900 more orders, generated $500K in additional revenue, and spent $34 more on average per order.  It is recommended that the loyalty program continue, and efforts should be made to promote the loyalty program.  

**Marketing Channels** – The direct marketing channel was the best marketing channel in terms of both total orders and total revenue from 2019 to 2022.  Social media was consistently on the bottom suggesting the need to create a more effective marketing strategy to increase presence across social media sites.  

**Operations** – 2022 saw no refunds which suggests a possible error in the data.  Apple Airpods were the highest refunded product from 2019-2021 accounting for 49% of all products refunded in each of these years.  The monthly average days to ship and average days to deliver were generally close to the overall average of 2.06 and 7.56 respectively, except for June 2019 where the average days to ship was 6.18 and average days to deliver was 11.74.
